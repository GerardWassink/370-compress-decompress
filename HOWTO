# HOWTO.md

## The files
These files must be uploaded using IND$FILE to a member in a PDS under your control. I worked on MVS3.8j TK4- under Hercules, so YMMV... I work on my MVS in the HERC01 user, so do ***NOT*** forget to change the 'HERC01' in the jobs where needed.

### gaw8051	
This is the assembler program, embedded in JCL statements. As a job, it will assemble the program and store the callable subroutine in HERC01.TEST.LOADLIB(GAW8051). This is done at the very end of the job.

### testpli
This job contains the PL/I program I made to be able to test the assembler program. It contains the hexadecimal print routine and some control info.
